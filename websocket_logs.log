Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product.

Thank you for your attention and participation in this session.\n\nWelcome to todays session on SAP. SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It is one of the leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platforms in the world. SAP enables organizations to integrate all of their business processes into a single unified system, including finance, supply chain, human resources, production, and customer relationship management.\n\nThe core module in SAP is the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC), which includes multiple functional modules like FI (Financial Accounting), CO (Controlling), MM (Materials Management), SD (Sales and Distribution), and HCM (Human Capital Management). Each module handles a specific business process and shares data in real time with other modules.\n\nOne of the most important transformations in SAPs evolution is the move from traditional ECC to SAP S/4HANA. S/4HANA is a next-generation ERP suite built on the SAP HANA in-memory database, providing significant improvements in performance, real-time analytics, and a simplified data model. S/4HANA allows companies to make faster decisions with real-time insights and process automation.\n\nSAP also includes tools like SAP Fiori for user experience, which provides a modern, role-based UI, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) for integration, data management, and extension scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nIn this lecture, we also explored common use cases. For instance, in a manufacturing company, SAP can be used to track raw materials using MM, plan production using PP, and process sales orders using SD  all linked through automated workflows and real-time data updates. This seamless integration helps reduce manual work, errors, and time delays across departments.\n\nBy the end of this session, you should be familiar with SAPs architecture, its key modules, the role of S/4HANA, and the benefits of using SAP for business transformation. In upcoming sessions, we will go deeper into hands-on SAP navigation and specific business scenarios.\n\n What is up guys, in this video I'm going to be showing you how you can get started with Python in less than 10 minutes. And I'm going to be using Python 3.8 for this, along with PyCharm as my code editor. You can just search these on Google and they will pop up immediately. They are free and open source. So definitely do check those out. Otherwise, let's get started immediately with the first thing you should know in Python, and that is how to assign values to variables. So to create a variable, all you have to do is decide on a name such as item, and then you can just assign it a value. This is a string and a string is just any form of text for the program to read. And you also need to keep in mind that Python is a case sensitive language, which means item with a small i and item with a big i are going to mean absolutely different things. And also a naming convention in Python is to add an underscore every time you have more than one word. So if we say item name, you want to add this underscore over here and we can just say orange. So now we have a few strings assigned to three different variables. Let's go ahead and print first the difference between item and item just to show you that there is a difference. So we'll go ahead and click on run. And you'll notice it will say banana and apple. Now let's go ahead and print another string, which this time is going to be hello. And we're going to add a plus and the item name. So as you can see, we can actually combine text. And when we print that, it's going to say hello orange. Next, we have data types. So the first one is the integer, which is just any number. And you're going to notice it being written in blue. Then we have strings, which as I showed you earlier, is just any text inside quotation marks. Then we have Booleans, which is just a simple true or false. So as you can see, we can just type in false here or true here. And that's all that it is. It just says true or false. And the final one you should know for getting started is list, which all you have to do is create a pair of angle brackets and insert the values you want inside here. And it can be a mixture between numbers, Booleans and so on. But for this example, we'll just keep it simple and write a few strings. Then if we go ahead and print these, you're going to notice that we will get 2021 text, false and the list. But let's move on to an example that we want to print these values combined. So let's say name is Mario. The string number is going to equal 22. So you're going to notice 2021 is a blue number and this one is green because this is considered text while this is considered an integer. So what we need to do is actually convert them into the correct types before combining them. So to do that, we can just go ahead and type in print name plus the string value of integer. So it's going to convert the integer to a string so that we can combine these two texts together. If we remove that and only write integer, you're going to notice we are going to get an exception that says we cannot do that. And the same thing goes for the string number. Pretend we want to add the value of 10 to the string number. The editor will be nice enough to tell you you shouldn't do that. And we should just put some parentheses there and type in int ahead of that so we can convert it to an integer and add it easily. Next, let's move on to math. So we will create two variables. One will be 10 and one will be 5. And to do math in Python, it's very self-explanatory. As you can see, to do addition, you just need to add a plus symbol for the difference. You just add a minus symbol to multiply. You add an asterisk to divide. You add a slash and if you want the exponential power, just add two asterisks. And you'll notice that if we print all of these, you're going to get a very quick calculator. So of course, 10 plus 5 is 15. A minus B is going to be 5. And so on. You will get the values that correspond to those operators. Okay, next, let's go ahead and create a logic statement. So we're going to use these two values. So is happy is false, age is 28. Let's pretend we want something to happen if the age is more than 21. We'll say print you are old. And if they are not old, we can also type in l if the age is equal to 18. We will tell them you are getting old. And if it's neither of those, we can go ahead and say you are still young. And the same thing goes with the is happy statement. So if we type in if the person is happy, we can write you are happy. Else they are probably not happy. So we will just write you are not happy. And when we play it, it's going to say they are not happy because is happy is false. And if we set this to true, it's going to change to you are happy. So the if statement just takes into account whether a statement is true or false. And depending on that, it's going to give the outcome of the values. And the if else statement is going to probably be your most used logic. Next, let's move on to the for loop. So for i in range of 3, which means it's going to loop over 3 values, we want to print hello. And we can add a comma here and the value of i. So if we print this, you're going to notice it's going to say hello 0, hello 1, hello 2. Because in programming, the index always starts at 0. So if you actually want that to start at 1, you're going to have to manually add 1 to i. So now you get hello 1, hello 2, hello 3. And also, just so you know what range is, we can go down here and we can go ahead and type in print range of 3. So you're going to notice it's going to create a range object, which is going to have the values from 0 to 3. So this can iterate three times over that. But you should also know that this works for lists. So we can create a name list and we can type in for name in name list. We can print the name. Next, we have a while loop. So we're just going to type in i equals 0. And while i is less than 5, we're going to increment the value of i by 1 each time it goes in this loop. And finally, we want to print the value of i. So what you should get are five values printed out just like this. Because as soon as this statement becomes false, it's going to exit out of this loop and just terminate the program. But a reason to use this is because you can create an infinite loop such as while true. And that's never going to be false. And inside here, we're going to type in user inputs and that's going to equal an input that says enter something. And if the user input is equal to the string of 0, then we're going to print we are done here and we are also going to break. And what break does is just cancel the loop, which means if we type in 0, this loop is no longer going to be valid and it's going to exit out of the program. Otherwise, it's going to loop forever. And if we actually play the program, you're going to notice that finally we can add some inputs so we can type in 10. We can do 2. We can type in whatever that is. But as soon as we type in 0, it's going to exit the loop because it will reach this break statement and the program will finish. Moving on to functions. To create a function, all you have to do is use the def keyword and just name the function however you like. Of course, I'm going to use the underscore naming convention. And this function is only going to be used to say hello to the user. So here we can go ahead and type in print. Hey there. And we're going to insert the name. So you might be wondering what are functions and what do we use functions for? Well, functions are just used to reuse your code in many different instances because the main point of programming is to reuse your code as much as possible. You want to maximize how often you can reuse the same line of code without having to rewrite it. So for example, now we created a function that says hello. We can type in Mario and we can also use it again and we can type in Luigi. And when we run the program, it will say hey there Mario and hey there Luigi. Instead of writing this statement twice, we were able to just use one function to do it multiple times. And one thing we should cover also on functions is pretend you have a lot of functions you need to create such as get internet and run game. Something such as that. And you don't really have the logic for it yet. So you're going to notice that these are empty. If you run the program, you're going to get an error. But Python has created this keyword that is called pass, which essentially just says there's nothing in here. We accept that and your program is still going to be able to run regardless of having no content inside the function. Now when we tap on run, you're going to notice there are going to be no errors because the program is going to understand that we provided the keyword pass, which just tells it that there's nothing there and it accepts it. But this is very good for creating the blueprints later in case you need to write everything your program should do, but don't really know how to do that yet. Just insert the word pass and it will save you a lot of trouble. And finally, we're going to go over how we can use the try and accept block. So for here, we're going to create an input and it's going to say please provide a number. So now we're going to go ahead and type in try and we're going to try to print the value plus the integer of the number that we get from the user. And if that doesn't work, we're going to print that that is not a valid number. So the way it works is it tries to execute the code that's inside here. And if anything goes wrong, if an exception occurs, it's going to go to the accept block and it's going to execute whatever is inside there. Of course, if you write something that throws an exception inside here, you need to try with another try and accept block. But if we go ahead and run the program now, we can write something like 10 and it's going to add 10 to the value. But of course, what if we write something such as Mario? Try adding Mario to 10 and the program is not going to be happy because you cannot convert Mario to an integer and then add it to 10. So it's going to say you shouldn't do that. But don't worry because we have the exception covered and our program will say that is not a valid number and not throw an exception. But anyway, I really hope that helped you to get started with Python. Of course, there's a lot more to cover. This was just meant as a very quick guide for helping you to get started. And with that being said, have a wonderful day and I'll see you guys in the next video.\n\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\nWelcome to today's lecture on artificial intelligence. In this session, we will explore the fundamental concepts and practical applications of AI across various industries. Artificial intelligence, a field within computer science, focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.\n\nWe begin by looking at the historical development of AI. Early researchers laid the foundations with simple rule-based systems, and over time, these evolved into sophisticated machine learning techniques. Today, machine learning is at the core of AI, and it is divided into areas such as supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled datasets, and unsupervised learning, which discovers hidden patterns in data without explicit labels.\n\nThe lecture also covers deep learning, a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns. Deep learning has led to breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. We will examine real-world case studies, such as medical diagnostic systems that use AI to detect diseases from imaging data, and financial algorithms that predict market movements.\n\nMoreover, we discuss the ethical challenges related to AI. Topics include algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the potential impact of automation on employment. By the end of this lecture, you should have gained a clear understanding of both the technological potential of AI and the societal implications it presents. Thank you for your attention and participation in this session.\n\nWelcome to todays session on SAP. SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It is one of the leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platforms in the world. SAP enables organizations to integrate all of their business processes into a single unified system, including finance, supply chain, human resources, production, and customer relationship management.\n\nThe core module in SAP is the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC), which includes multiple functional modules like FI (Financial Accounting), CO (Controlling), MM (Materials Management), SD (Sales and Distribution), and HCM (Human Capital Management). Each module handles a specific business process and shares data in real time with other modules.\n\nOne of the most important transformations in SAPs evolution is the move from traditional ECC to SAP S/4HANA. S/4HANA is a next-generation ERP suite built on the SAP HANA in-memory database, providing significant improvements in performance, real-time analytics, and a simplified data model. S/4HANA allows companies to make faster decisions with real-time insights and process automation.\n\nSAP also includes tools like SAP Fiori for user experience, which provides a modern, role-based UI, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) for integration, data management, and extension scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nIn this lecture, we also explored common use cases. For instance, in a manufacturing company, SAP can be used to track raw materials using MM, plan production using PP, and process sales orders using SD  all linked through automated workflows and real-time data updates. This seamless integration helps reduce manual work, errors, and time delays across departments.\n\nBy the end of this session, you should be familiar with SAPs architecture, its key modules, the role of S/4HANA, and the benefits of using SAP for business transformation. In upcoming sessions, we will go deeper into hands-on SAP navigation and specific business scenarios.\n\n What is up guys, in this video I'm going to be showing you how you can get started with Python in less than 10 minutes. And I'm going to be using Python 3.8 for this, along with PyCharm as my code editor. You can just search these on Google and they will pop up immediately. They are free and open source. So definitely do check those out. Otherwise, let's get started immediately with the first thing you should know in Python, and that is how to assign values to variables. So to create a variable, all you have to do is decide on a name such as item, and then you can just assign it a value. This is a string and a string is just any form of text for the program to read. And you also need to keep in mind that Python is a case sensitive language, which means item with a small i and item with a big i are going to mean absolutely different things. And also a naming convention in Python is to add an underscore every time you have more than one word. So if we say item name, you want to add this underscore over here and we can just say orange. So now we have a few strings assigned to three different variables. Let's go ahead and print first the difference between item and item just to show you that there is a difference. So we'll go ahead and click on run. And you'll notice it will say banana and apple. Now let's go ahead and print another string, which this time is going to be hello. And we're going to add a plus and the item name. So as you can see, we can actually combine text. And when we print that, it's going to say hello orange. Next, we have data types. So the first one is the integer, which is just any number. And you're going to notice it being written in blue. Then we have strings, which as I showed you earlier, is just any text inside quotation marks. Then we have Booleans, which is just a simple true or false. So as you can see, we can just type in false here or true here. And that's all that it is. It just says true or false. And the final one you should know for getting started is list, which all you have to do is create a pair of angle brackets and insert the values you want inside here. And it can be a mixture between numbers, Booleans and so on. But for this example, we'll just keep it simple and write a few strings. Then if we go ahead and print these, you're going to notice that we will get 2021 text, false and the list. But let's move on to an example that we want to print these values combined. So let's say name is Mario. The string number is going to equal 22. So you're going to notice 2021 is a blue number and this one is green because this is considered text while this is considered an integer. So what we need to do is actually convert them into the correct types before combining them. So to do that, we can just go ahead and type in print name plus the string value of integer. So it's going to convert the integer to a string so that we can combine these two texts together. If we remove that and only write integer, you're going to notice we are going to get an exception that says we cannot do that. And the same thing goes for the string number. Pretend we want to add the value of 10 to the string number. The editor will be nice enough to tell you you shouldn't do that. And we should just put some parentheses there and type in int ahead of that so we can convert it to an integer and add it easily. Next, let's move on to math. So we will create two variables. One will be 10 and one will be 5. And to do math in Python, it's very self-explanatory. As you can see, to do addition, you just need to add a plus symbol for the difference. You just add a minus symbol to multiply. You add an asterisk to divide. You add a slash and if you want the exponential power, just add two asterisks. And you'll notice that if we print all of these, you're going to get a very quick calculator. So of course, 10 plus 5 is 15. A minus B is going to be 5. And so on. You will get the values that correspond to those operators. Okay, next, let's go ahead and create a logic statement. So we're going to use these two values. So is happy is false, age is 28. Let's pretend we want something to happen if the age is more than 21. We'll say print you are old. And if they are not old, we can also type in l if the age is equal to 18. We will tell them you are getting old. And if it's neither of those, we can go ahead and say you are still young. And the same thing goes with the is happy statement. So if we type in if the person is happy, we can write you are happy. Else they are probably not happy. So we will just write you are not happy. And when we play it, it's going to say they are not happy because is happy is false. And if we set this to true, it's going to change to you are happy. So the if statement just takes into account whether a statement is true or false. And depending on that, it's going to give the outcome of the values. And the if else statement is going to probably be your most used logic. Next, let's move on to the for loop. So for i in range of 3, which means it's going to loop over 3 values, we want to print hello. And we can add a comma here and the value of i. So if we print this, you're going to notice it's going to say hello 0, hello 1, hello 2. Because in programming, the index always starts at 0. So if you actually want that to start at 1, you're going to have to manually add 1 to i. So now you get hello 1, hello 2, hello 3. And also, just so you know what range is, we can go down here and we can go ahead and type in print range of 3. So you're going to notice it's going to create a range object, which is going to have the values from 0 to 3. So this can iterate three times over that. But you should also know that this works for lists. So we can create a name list and we can type in for name in name list. We can print the name. Next, we have a while loop. So we're just going to type in i equals 0. And while i is less than 5, we're going to increment the value of i by 1 each time it goes in this loop. And finally, we want to print the value of i. So what you should get are five values printed out just like this. Because as soon as this statement becomes false, it's going to exit out of this loop and just terminate the program. But a reason to use this is because you can create an infinite loop such as while true. And that's never going to be false. And inside here, we're going to type in user inputs and that's going to equal an input that says enter something. And if the user input is equal to the string of 0, then we're going to print we are done here and we are also going to break. And what break does is just cancel the loop, which means if we type in 0, this loop is no longer going to be valid and it's going to exit out of the program. Otherwise, it's going to loop forever. And if we actually play the program, you're going to notice that finally we can add some inputs so we can type in 10. We can do 2. We can type in whatever that is. But as soon as we type in 0, it's going to exit the loop because it will reach this break statement and the program will finish. Moving on to functions. To create a function, all you have to do is use the def keyword and just name the function however you like. Of course, I'm going to use the underscore naming convention. And this function is only going to be used to say hello to the user. So here we can go ahead and type in print. Hey there. And we're going to insert the name. So you might be wondering what are functions and what do we use functions for? Well, functions are just used to reuse your code in many different instances because the main point of programming is to reuse your code as much as possible. You want to maximize how often you can reuse the same line of code without having to rewrite it. So for example, now we created a function that says hello. We can type in Mario and we can also use it again and we can type in Luigi. And when we run the program, it will say hey there Mario and hey there Luigi. Instead of writing this statement twice, we were able to just use one function to do it multiple times. And one thing we should cover also on functions is pretend you have a lot of functions you need to create such as get internet and run game. Something such as that. And you don't really have the logic for it yet. So you're going to notice that these are empty. If you run the program, you're going to get an error. But Python has created this keyword that is called pass, which essentially just says there's nothing in here. We accept that and your program is still going to be able to run regardless of having no content inside the function. Now when we tap on run, you're going to notice there are going to be no errors because the program is going to understand that we provided the keyword pass, which just tells it that there's nothing there and it accepts it. But this is very good for creating the blueprints later in case you need to write everything your program should do, but don't really know how to do that yet. Just insert the word pass and it will save you a lot of trouble. And finally, we're going to go over how we can use the try and accept block. So for here, we're going to create an input and it's going to say please provide a number. So now we're going to go ahead and type in try and we're going to try to print the value plus the integer of the number that we get from the user. And if that doesn't work, we're going to print that that is not a valid number. So the way it works is it tries to execute the code that's inside here. And if anything goes wrong, if an exception occurs, it's going to go to the accept block and it's going to execute whatever is inside there. Of course, if you write something that throws an exception inside here, you need to try with another try and accept block. But if we go ahead and run the program now, we can write something like 10 and it's going to add 10 to the value. But of course, what if we write something such as Mario? Try adding Mario to 10 and the program is not going to be happy because you cannot convert Mario to an integer and then add it to 10. So it's going to say you shouldn't do that. But don't worry because we have the exception covered and our program will say that is not a valid number and not throw an exception. But anyway, I really hope that helped you to get started with Python. Of course, there's a lot more to cover. This was just meant as a very quick guide for helping you to get started. And with that being said, have a wonderful day and I'll see you guys in the next video.\n\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Can you briefly explain what artificial intelligence (AI) is and its primary purpose?\"}"}],"question_count":1,"conversation_log":"Lecture Interview\nTranscript Summary: Welcome to today's lecture on artificial intelligence.

Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Can you explain the difference between a system refresh and a system copy in SAP?\"}"}],"question_count":1,"conversation_log":"Lecture Interview\nTranscript Summary:  Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh.

DEBUG 2025-05-06 16:03:20,162 consumers Received message for session f2e1650e-cec2-4b85-b756-a68682f87db1: {"type":"submit_answer","session_id":"f2e1650e-cec2-4b85-b756-a68682f87db1","answer":"yeah when we are performing the production system data copying to the quality system","state":{"transcript":" Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Can you explain the difference between a system refresh and a system copy in SAP?\"}"},{"role":"user","content":"system refresh is nothing but back up and Restoration from the production to quality system system copy is nothing but build a new system in the existing landscape by using established classical system copy homogenous system copy we can"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Thank you for your explanation.

Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Can you explain the difference between a system refresh and a system copy in SAP?\"}"},{"role":"user","content":"system refresh is nothing but back up and Restoration from the production to quality system system copy is nothing but build a new system in the existing landscape by using established classical system copy homogenous system copy we can"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Thank you for your explanation.

Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Can you explain the difference between a system refresh and a system copy in SAP?\"}"},{"role":"user","content":"system refresh is nothing but back up and Restoration from the production to quality system system copy is nothing but build a new system in the existing landscape by using established classical system copy homogenous system copy we can"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Thank you for your explanation.

Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Can you explain the difference between a system refresh and a system copy in SAP?\"}"},{"role":"user","content":"system refresh is nothing but back up and Restoration from the production to quality system system copy is nothing but build a new system in the existing landscape by using established classical system copy homogenous system copy we can"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Thank you for your explanation.

In upcoming sessions, we will go deeper into hands-on SAP navigation and specific business scenarios.\n\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\nWelcome to todays session on SAP. SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It is one of the leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platforms in the world. SAP enables organizations to integrate all of their business processes into a single unified system, including finance, supply chain, human resources, production, and customer relationship management.\n\nThe core module in SAP is the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC), which includes multiple functional modules like FI (Financial Accounting), CO (Controlling), MM (Materials Management), SD (Sales and Distribution), and HCM (Human Capital Management). Each module handles a specific business process and shares data in real time with other modules.\n\nOne of the most important transformations in SAPs evolution is the move from traditional ECC to SAP S/4HANA. S/4HANA is a next-generation ERP suite built on the SAP HANA in-memory database, providing significant improvements in performance, real-time analytics, and a simplified data model. S/4HANA allows companies to make faster decisions with real-time insights and process automation.\n\nSAP also includes tools like SAP Fiori for user experience, which provides a modern, role-based UI, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) for integration, data management, and extension scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nIn this lecture, we also explored common use cases. For instance, in a manufacturing company, SAP can be used to track raw materials using MM, plan production using PP, and process sales orders using SD  all linked through automated workflows and real-time data updates. This seamless integration helps reduce manual work, errors, and time delays across departments.\n\nBy the end of this session, you should be familiar with SAPs architecture, its key modules, the role of S/4HANA, and the benefits of using SAP for business transformation. In upcoming sessions, we will go deeper into hands-on SAP navigation and specific business scenarios.\n\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Okay, let's begin the interview.

SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It is one of the leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platforms in the world. SAP enables organizations to integrate all of their business processes into a single unified system, including finance, supply chain, human resources, production, and customer relationship management.\n\nThe core module in SAP is the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC), which includes multiple functional modules like FI (Financial Accounting), CO (Controlling), MM (Materials Management), SD (Sales and Distribution), and HCM (Human Capital Management). Each module handles a specific business process and shares data in real time with other modules.\n\nOne of the most important transformations in SAPs evolution is the move from traditional ECC to SAP S/4HANA. S/4HANA is a next-generation ERP suite built on the SAP HANA in-memory database, providing significant improvements in performance, real-time analytics, and a simplified data model. S/4HANA allows companies to make faster decisions with real-time insights and process automation.\n\nSAP also includes tools like SAP Fiori for user experience, which provides a modern, role-based UI, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) for integration, data management, and extension scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nIn this lecture, we also explored common use cases. For instance, in a manufacturing company, SAP can be used to track raw materials using MM, plan production using PP, and process sales orders using SD  all linked through automated workflows and real-time data updates. This seamless integration helps reduce manual work, errors, and time delays across departments.\n\nBy the end of this session, you should be familiar with SAPs architecture, its key modules, the role of S/4HANA, and the benefits of using SAP for business transformation. In upcoming sessions, we will go deeper into hands-on SAP navigation and specific business scenarios.\n\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess","mode":"lecture","custom_info":{},"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a professional interviewer conducting an interview based on lecture transcripts.\n\nInstructions:\n- Ask exactly 10 questions, one at a time, based on the provided transcript.\n- Match the difficulty to an intermediate level suitable for a fresher.\n- Use a professional tone.\n- Output only a JSON object with 'type' ('question' or 'conclusion') and 'content' (question text or conclusion message).\n- If a response is off-topic or insufficient, guide the user back or ask for clarification.\n- After the 10th question, return a conclusion summarizing the interview.\n\nTranscript:\nWelcome to todays session on SAP. SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It is one of the leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platforms in the world. SAP enables organizations to integrate all of their business processes into a single unified system, including finance, supply chain, human resources, production, and customer relationship management.\n\nThe core module in SAP is the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC), which includes multiple functional modules like FI (Financial Accounting), CO (Controlling), MM (Materials Management), SD (Sales and Distribution), and HCM (Human Capital Management). Each module handles a specific business process and shares data in real time with other modules.\n\nOne of the most important transformations in SAPs evolution is the move from traditional ECC to SAP S/4HANA. S/4HANA is a next-generation ERP suite built on the SAP HANA in-memory database, providing significant improvements in performance, real-time analytics, and a simplified data model. S/4HANA allows companies to make faster decisions with real-time insights and process automation.\n\nSAP also includes tools like SAP Fiori for user experience, which provides a modern, role-based UI, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) for integration, data management, and extension scenarios in cloud environments.\n\nIn this lecture, we also explored common use cases. For instance, in a manufacturing company, SAP can be used to track raw materials using MM, plan production using PP, and process sales orders using SD  all linked through automated workflows and real-time data updates. This seamless integration helps reduce manual work, errors, and time delays across departments.\n\nBy the end of this session, you should be familiar with SAPs architecture, its key modules, the role of S/4HANA, and the benefits of using SAP for business transformation. In upcoming sessions, we will go deeper into hands-on SAP navigation and specific business scenarios.\n\n Okay, guys, we'll start system refresh. Okay, guys. In SAP, we have the two types of data copies from environment to environment or it might be the database to database. Okay. So in this data copies case, we can do with the two methods. One is system refresh and one is system copy. Okay, what is the meaning of system refresh and what is the meaning of system copy? Guys, every quarter, okay, so for doing the live testing the with the live data, testing the quality system with the live data, then keep on request you to take the backup of your production system and they request you to restore into the quality system. Okay, so this mechanism we call it as a system refresh. So from which system we are bringing here? Production to quality. So in system refresh, both the systems should have the same database, both the systems should have the same version. Here target is which way it will come? So now target system here should be the same version or it should be the higher than that in the database part. The restoration where we are doing in the database level. So the data base system should be same or higher. So we take the copy of backup of your production system till what they request it and we will restore into the quality system. But when you dump this restoration, what it will happen? It will overwrite the quality system data, which means as of now, whatever the configuration setup you have done, it might be operation mode, it might be the logon group configuration, it might be the SLD related settings, it might be the HMS configuration, it might be the water, it might be in production system how it is there as it will come and sit in the quality system. It might be security certificates, it might be the router related configuration, water it might be, everything even launchpad related, SMC setup related, everywhere what are the changes you have done in the application configuration. As it is in production system, how it is there same it will come and sit in the quality system, including the background jobs each and everything. So now quality system behave like a production system. So but this should behave like a quality system. So for that one, what we will take, what we will do? This activity they segregated into the total three, that is pre-refresh steps. And DB, refresh and then post-refresh steps. Pre-refresh steps means what are the configurations we have done in the quality system. Everything we take into the one document. So everything, every setting we take the backup or if we contact the backup we take the screenshot reference. In the pre-refresh step, every configuration, every activity we take into that one document will prepare as well as we take the some individual backups, individual backups in quality system how it is there. So after that we will perform that once we finish the pre-refresh steps, if you confirm to the backup team or if they have given any document to you to restore. So according to that one we have to restore the production data into the quality system. Once quality system restoration is completed, what we have to do? So if I start again for example some invoice sending related or backup some kind of what we called invoice sending related or purchase address related, it has to be sent to the customer. If such kind of things is there duplicate it will send to the customers. So if we start means immediately it will start sending. So we have to stop that one. So such kind of background that whatever it is there those are the one you have to stop. So without starting your database can you able to stop that one? No. First you have to make that if you make the number of background work process zero will your background work jobs will be done? No. So first you have to make the background work process zero and then you have to start the system and then you have to start the system. So immediately delete the background jobs these and all. After deleting the background jobs and mail sending related contractions will be there in the SCOT. Sorry I have not completed it. Here we are going like that. We have to disable that contractions everything and then again we have to make the number of background work process to normal value and then we have to take the restart. Once you started then you have to with your document. So each and everything we are taking the screenshot reference and backup right. As this you have to reconfigure. As this you have to reconfigure. If any backup if you have taken to the diversity as those and all you have to reimport. For example in quality system only test users only it will be there. In production system business end users, name users and contract users will be there. Those end users and all we should not allow to log into the our test boxes. So what we have to do we have to overwrite those. For example I am telling you. For that one we will take what we will do we will take the user master record export. In that part of pre-report and that if you import it again quality users only again they will come back right. It will overwrite the data and RFC destinations is there. RFC destination contractions and all it will store into the total five to six tables. Those tables and all if you log into the TR. If again if you import it for production system whatever the RFC is there those and all it will be overwritten with the original quality RFC. Like this each and everything we have to sort out. That we call it as a post-repress step. As part of pre-repress step in your target system which means quality system each and every configuration you have you have to take the backup and then you have to restore the production and you have to make sure number of background work process zero and then you have to start the application and remove the background jobs and disable the start configuration and again revert back your parameter number of background work process and then start your system. So why we need to revert back here if you need to import the without revert thing back here if you need to import the TR will it import? Why? Background work process zero. TR import it will depends on the added MBD. So this kind of and all we have to make sure even license will be changed. Production license will again come back. Again you have to download the whole quality license key and again you have to import. This kind of activities and all we will do it in the post-repress step. You understand that what is system request? Now I am coming to the system copy. Guys system copy means in your landscape or might be to build a new landscape with the existing data. You can export and import the data to the target system. So for example adding the new system to landscape adding the new system to landscape with any of existing system data with any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Just observe the difference guys. Most of the people will fail to give the answer here. System refresh means in the existing landscape taking the production data backup and restoring into the quality system overwriting the quality system. Every data only configuration settings only we are again reverting back. Original data actually it will be there customer changing every customer data. So that we call it as a system refresh and adding the new system to your landscape we call it as a system copy by using the any one of the existing system data. Is there any one of the existing system data we call it as a system copy. Why we need to perform system refresh? In which is why we need to perform system copy, system refresh and why we need to in which kind of situations we will perform the system refresh. Guys here day to day they will do the testing right. So I have done testing now. So day by day it is going regular support activities. But I planned some major change. My live data that whether that major change will exactly will work or not. Exactly it will work or not. Where you can decide? In QA system. So but in QA system is not up to date as of now. If I do the system refresh periodically time to time original data I will keep it there. So what we will do every quarter they will plan for the quality system refresh before like for example I have some major change I have planned in the production system. As of now only few features is there. But if I upgrade also those features in my business I have some separate functionality I require. But that functionality is not there in the SAP software. Even they are telling like even latest upgrade also those features and it won't come. But according to the current trend I have to do my business like this only. Once we have done guys so what we can do? We can plan for our own customizations. So they planned. But if the changes actually if I move to the production whether it will work or not. If I move what it will be corrupted. So we can't predict. So what will if the same data if it is there in the quality every scenario every aspect every business area I can test it right. So everything once every test case sign up then only you can move to the production. So in test case if any change is occurred again they will do the redevelopment in the or remodification in the development and those corrections here they will give to you to import. So if I everything once it is finalized here if I move as it is to the production system. So there shouldn't be any issue if anything is occurred also very minimal and minor. So that immediately you can correct it right. So your business loss will be reduced. So that's the reason they'll recommend you to do that every quarter or they request every quarter perform the system reflation. So they'll ask question like in which situation why we need to perform the system refresh. What we have to say? When to test the live data to test the live data in quality system before moving the major changes to the quality system. Before moving that. What? I didn't understand the document. I didn't understand the document. But you can write the question and answer sheet. So before when we need to perform the quality system refresh means to test the live data in the quality system before moving the major changes to the production system. So to avoid business downtime and avoid the major business loss we do the every quarter system request. That's it. Before you are doing upgrade of production system. So before before quarter we will do it. For example my production system I planned upgrade in the so and so data quality system. So first I will do the system refresh and then I'll do the upgrade in the quality system. Why? Here two major advantages. One is production system how long it will take downtime you can predict. And one more is if those changes how it will behave in the those latest upgrade changes. How it will behave in the production system you only can test it. Right. That is one aspect. And one more is major customizations. When? When before moving the major customization to the production system we'll do the quality system refresh. Okay. And system refresh. So system refresh means to add the new text box or to add the new development system. The system copy. To add the new text box or to add the new quality system. So at that time we do the system copy. System copy you can do it in the different aspects. You can do the migration also. The system copy mechanism you can do the migration. To do the system refresh both source and target database should be the same. Same version. Right. It should be the same. Which means Anna to Hanna only. Oracle to Hanna you can't do it. Restoration. Only Hanna to Hanna only backup and recall you can do it. Right. So you should have the same system which will be the same version and same sizes of the disk file system. Disk file system should be the same. Okay. But you can eligible to do the system refresh. But system copy you can do it for the cross operating system. Cross databases. Cross operating system as well as cross database. Cross environments also. Cross like on premise to cloud. Cloud to on premise. Cross infrastructures also. How you want it you can do it. Okay. So generally in system copy what we will do? We will take the pre. Here it is nothing but adding the new system. Right. So here we will do the export of the what is that? Export of the source system and importing into the target system. Okay. Exporting of the source system means exporting of the source system in our landscape. I have the development for example. So I am not satisfied with the what is the hardware. I purchased it in the 15 years back. It is almost outdated. So even that would not support the latest operating systems to run. For that one what I have to do? I have to purchase the I5 processor. Will it support I5 eighth generation or seventh generation processor? Will it support the Windows 11? No. Only eighth generation onwards only it is supporting the Windows 11. Before version it would not support processor hardware processor type. So even that does not have that much capability. So what I have to do? I have to change the hardware. Hardware change is nothing but entire I have to purchase the new PC. So even same motherboard if I want to insert the latest version of the processor also it will not be supported. So what I have to do? I have to sell it out to cheaper price and I have to purchase the new PC. So same concept here. For example if it might be the hardware change or it might be the operating system change or it might be the database change. What are it might be the reason or infrastructure change on premise to cloud on premise to cloud. What are it might be the reason? So what will for example already have the one scenario will take it. How? Quality and production system. Okay. Customer asked me can you please change the hardware? Hardware means hard disk if you remove from the old version of the hard disk also very old version right. So nowadays everything is the SSD. That is also with the small size it is coming instead of your laptop. So it won't be the best fit. What I have to do? I have to build the I have to deploy the request the vendor to hardware vendor to deploy the new hardware and on top of that I have to build the new development system. That is the only choice I have. But what about what are the customizations existing data how I can copy to this one. Right. So in this scenario you can build with the same version level and you can do the backup of this. If it is you have planned the same database same operating system same database same application you can take the backup of this one you can restore it. But if you operating system I'm not satisfied with the windows is asking more security features if any cyber attack or any virus attack is happened. Every time I have to do that business down. So to avoid such kind of situation I decided to go to the Linux operating system on the new hardware. Even Linux is cheaper compared to Windows. So I plan to go ahead with the Linux. What I have to do? The platform is changing. But my data existing is best to suit to the Windows online. Here it is changing right. What I will do? I will take that we have the SWPM tool right. By running with SWPM tool you can take the export of the Dev system export of the Dev system. It will prepare export file. It will prepare the export file with as is your data as is your data. And I will log into target system. But there is a compatibility issues there. Right. So you have to download the one more SWPM file. Linux compatible and Linux compatible kernel files. Linux compatible kernel files. Independent and DB dependent. And then what are the export file already prepared with the existing data. So you don't need to download the export business logic kernel we have exported. We keep it safe. And export files already we have. And what are the required database software same version are higher than the your source DB version. So you have to download all those things and you have to run the SWPM tool. In the system copy option only you have the two sections. Export the data and import the data. You have to select the this type import the data. What is that? Import the data. Now it will ask start. So when you select the business component it will ask what is the asset? What are the master parts required? What is the instance numbers? And the locations of the kernel files. Locations of the your export you prepared export down. Okay. That location and database software each and everything it will ask. If you give in and if you give the parameter if you continue. Here only it will ask migration key. In this mechanism it will ask the migration key. We have selected the standard export files. We have selected the our existing files. Migration key. We have to generate that one. Then what it will do? It will import the new system. Nothing but build the new system. Build the new system with the existing data. Which we call it as a system copy. And which we call it as a here what changes happened in this scenario. OS. Operating system. So this we call it as a OS migration. But here challenging thing in the system copy is preparation. What is that? Preparation. Generally business logic data it will comes in the when you are doing fresh installation. It will comes with a very minimal size. Very minimal size. Without data it will come. With the business logic only. So that will be 20 GB or 30 GB or 40 GB. As far as ELP files means. 60 GB files it will come. But here your source DB is 1 TB 1 TB data you have to export. And you have to import it. It will take lot of time. That time you have to minimize. That time you have to minimize. How you can minimize optimize or minimize? Both are same ways. How to optimize that? By removing the unwanted data. By removing the unwanted data. From the tables. Unwanted data. Unnecessary data will be there. So such kind of data and all you can remove it. And what others you can do it. Increase the hardware resources. By increasing the hardware resources. Maximum number of parallel process. Maximum number of CPUs. If you increase the number of CPUs you can. Number of parallel process also. When you are importing. It will ask how many jobs you have. Standardly you take in number of CPUs into 3. So even when you are installing new system. Installation also it will ask. Here also it will ask the same. So if you under large tables is there. Big size of tables is there. In that you can't remove any data. So such kind of tables by splitting the table partitioning. By doing the table splitting. Not partitioning. Table splitting. One table you can maximum number of spits you can do. So you can do it. So you can do it. You can maximum number of spits you can do it. For example. One. 10 tables it has 10 GB. And 11 GB. And 20 GB like this. Remaining are small small. When you give parallel process. Big size table it will keep on take run. Remaining tables. And it will complete and it will wait until. These are finishing. To go to the next table. So if you split those tables into the parts. 1 GB 1 GB 1 GB. It will finish very quickly right. So that's the reason we have to perform the. Table splitting. How you can optimize? By increasing the resources. And by removing the unwanted data. From the tables level. And you can split the tables. You can split the tables. So before you are starting export. You have to do this section. Okay. After that export. While exporting it will. Data will be split into the parts. From the table. While importing. It will parallel import the data. Parallel import the data. So. Let's try it. In network. 1 MB file you transfer. Very quickly finish. 1 GB file you transfer. It will take lot of time. In between that. It can handle the remaining services. What it is available. Thus it can handle the more. So if you split. Here some resources. That 10 GB. It will split into the. Free resources. It will split up your activity. Parallel it will do. That's the reason you have to do that. Table splitting. That is the challenging thing. Very simple. So we have to. Detect the. What is the big size table. And each and every table size. Make sure. Not more than 1 GB. For example 10 GB table is there. Or 11 GB table is there. Split into the 11 parts. Split into the 11 parts. For example if you have the. 21 GB split into the. 21 parts. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. So some people they will consider. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. 1 GB. So this is a. Compatible version. While exporting what is your target database. So if we give the list. For example if it is the same. It is okay. If you select the different. It will comes as a database migration. It will comes as a database migration. So the same export data you are. You have to import into the. Target system right. This we call it as a database migration. Okay so. Close the mic on premise. Infrastructure we have data center here. I have around 60 servers. Okay 60 business. Applications. So what we will do. We plan for each and everything. So we will export from here. And we will import into the. We will move this data to the. Cloud storage and from there. We will import the. Data into the cloud VM. Cloud VM. We call it as a cloud migration. Same. But the tool how we have to use it. How we have to optimize the. Time. Why means for example guys. Here production system. We have the 4 TB of size. How much? 4 TB. 4 TB to export the data means. How long it will take. Until that export is finishing. Your production system also will be in the. Down. It has to be put all the data. It has to be prepared. And that 4 TB data you have to copy. To the. Cloud environment. And again there you have to import. How long it will take. Days and days it will take. So 1 GB. Almost 10 minutes or 20 minutes it is taking to copy. If in the network. If I need to transfer 4 TB means. Right. So export it has to be do. Copy to the target environment. And then I can put it there. Start the importing. So days and days it will waste. Until that if I stop the business. I will get the last writer. So to work on this. In this export and import mechanism. We have the parallel export and import. Parallel export and import. One side you can export the data. And at the same time you can import the data into the. You can import into the. Target system. Here what are the new data it is exporting to the same. Storage location. That it will capture and it will keep on import into the. Target system. So export and import both it will happens in the. Same time. But that one if you set up your export dump location. You specifically set with the. Target. Both it will happen. At the same time you can do it. This mechanism we call it as a export. And import. In this mechanism we have the two types of it. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import. Serial export and import. First we will complete the. Export. Once it is export is completed. That data dump. As it will copy to the target server. After that. There we will start the import. This mechanism we call it as a. Serial export and import. And parallel export and import means. That data dump will be. At the same time. At the same time. At the same time. Export the data and import into the. Target system. This mechanism we call it as a. One side. Export is happening. And one side import is happening. For that one what we will do. We have the MFS. Same directory you can share with the. With the target server also. Export it will place it here. While if you are given that location. Export dump location while importing. So it will start keep on collecting the data. From the. This export location. One side it will keep on update this files. What are the new data changes occurring. Those changes and all it will import into the. Target. Almost. You are saving the. Half of the time. More than that. So this mechanism we call it as a. Export and import. These are the things which you need to learn in the. Migration. So I am planning to complete. For you. Both the things guys. One is system refresh. That is the reason I told. So system refresh if you understand. Automatically you can understand that. Migration also. Here migration also. When you copy from here to here. New environment. Based on the change. Based on the target system also. So if you are maintaining same hostname. Same IP address. There is no issue. If you are changing that hostname. RFC connections will be affected. And your configuration settings. Anywhere if you maintain the hostname. Those and all. It will be affected. Instance memory if you are changing. Or if you are changing anything. So based on that you have to prepare the. Pre-refresh steps and post-refresh steps. And post-number changes. Will be changed. So to avoid that you have to prepare the pre-export steps. And post import steps. So without affecting your systems. You have to. Do the activity. Resolve all. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Pre-export step. And post import step. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So you have to do the same. So this is what we call it as a. Export and import. Or system copy. Some people will call it as a system copy. Some people will call it as a. Migration. So migration in the sense. You can do the. OS migration. AB migration. Migration. Anything. So in this what you need to know. Minimizing the downtime. In the sense. Reducing the time. Right. So for that one what is the mechanism we have. Parallel export and. Import. Clear. So guys. Here. In the interview question and answer. All these topics are. Maintained. What is what. So. So. So. So. And then. Migration. That. How to do that. SCC. That. That. So. Guys. Every organization. They maintain. The. System refresh. System refresh. So. How to restore the. From the post-repressive. Everyone will maintain the. This document. Before you are. Starting the system. Okay, so but before you are if you want to follow the document as it means you should be expedited that Right so that so different people they'll maintain different formats one piece some of the people they maintain in the excel sheet Some of the people they'll maintain in the what document just I will show you You Yes, see with the production data they reached out the sandbox what they done first to pre-release steps I'll show you guys one by one we do practice first what they done they taken that user master the card they logged into the target system which means quality and And They are taking the user master the card export by executing the t-code SCA with a proper SAP underscore user and with a target client So this backup where it will be as a profile in data file. It will be stored in the your Translator so that my backup is there right so see here Let's have a started record Okay, this is very very important this here water critical a given every level they lost the cross question What's the difference between system the pressure system copy and? What why we need to perform the system refresh so system copy is nothing, but what are the mechanisms you can drive them? Okay, so these are not there us so immediately you can do that So see here guys this guy is captured everything screenshot Here on the How it is okay So within the system target system is given like a within the system one within that system not the target by mistakenly to import into the other system again it will Corrupted that system so within the system I said only will give it. I'll show you one by one first so kick Mark in the what are the T as it is creating us. What is the yes it is creating and then? Why means again I have to import the same tiering the within the system So export completed is successfully everything you have to keep it as evidence the screenshot So take screenshot of your sfp4 which means how many clients is there each and every client settings each and every client settings after restoration in quite a system earlier how the client settings is there same as you have to maintain and But this you can't take the backup the settings and all that's the reason we are taking the screenshot and logon group screenshot And then Operation modes Okay, and take the exporting of the 11 SC 0 3 SM 61 what is that 11? SC03 SM 61 backups Just you take in that copy and paste it here So take the screenshot of a 11 and SM 61 what is the background job group name they created and SP ad SP ad means Printers how many printers is there testing printers test printers those and all you have to take the bad half Okay, so take the screenshots of your Operation modes okay And last call system names, what is that last call system names? So we should also show me last call system names how you can lock into the tl so by using SC01 transaction and create the transport request to For backing up the 11 SC03 SMLG so and so and these and all you can lock into that those respective Ters Transport of copies and lock all those into the All these tables these are the program ID and this is the object at this is the Table all these you lock into that particular Yeah Okay, so when locking these and all So By locking these and all so all these settings are jitter to the rj 0 port Everything it will be in the screenshot reference and I will have Settings backup everything you have to take the backup and then You have to save it and release that here. It is the diversity So all those settings it is locked into the tl and even when you release locally and into the By specifying the target part If you need by mistakenly locally that's it without noticing that if you perform the refresh Okay, yes, so once you have taken all those backups We have to perform the database Restoration database restoration. I shown you right Arachan how to restore Okay, so cross system first you have to to log into the production system. We have to take the control file backup in the production system and you have to copy the backup files into the quality system along with the control file and you have to restore and recover and then run the control file Run the control and recover it and all the database open reset logs every step it will be there guys. I'll show you don't worry Reduction is just me and the gap to practice chairman you can After practice is the dish So I'm just showing different people how they will approach Okay, so like this this is the organization document guys, it's not outside we prepared Inside of the organization they prepared document every step it will be there Okay. So after doing that how to Start your system how to proceed with that one each and every what are the post? Activities how we got to import that ER each and everything it will be there Okay, so this is one kind of format so this not ours And I'll show you one more simple document So for example here NWT is the quality test box and the NWP is the production system in NWT So perform the three refreshments what he done first he taken this screenshot of the License key and the screenshot of operation modes And log-on load balancing and RFC groups DBA calendar to finish jobs is there and taken the For as I see him this we prepared document guys, so don't worry. Okay, so don't think like a airports are not there We this document we prepared. Okay, so here for port reference purpose this one So under landscape directory rz-70 And SLD API cusht if any setting is there for making more down that time and backup of the Distribution model view so they'll transfer that data in the some kind of IDA permit things So for that one they will configure the source to target some kind of Distribution model view that settings backup. So those are to create one TUC here Unlock all these TR changes is table changes into the that particular TUC here for evidence purpose. So after importing this tear also if they Told I didn't this would edit data for reference purpose. We had okay I send the Target and Finished for evidence purpose. We have beside we are taking the screenshot So like this partner profiles and ports You know need to remember all these tables guys. You can remember like the edp stock What is that in case if you ask what are the partner profiles and the first tables meet edp stock that's it Okay, and the distribution model means TD LS something is there. Okay, so start tables and take the user master card export And then back up the RFC destination tables all your in SM 15 and you are conferring the RFC's writer All those data it will stores into the these tables RFC attribute RFC check RFC DS RFC BSC Q and RFC doc these five tables it will store if you take in this backup by Latin to US territory So if you import again, it will revert back the changes And then Take that if you can't forget any trusted RFC take that how many trusted RFC is there for which which system? Take that one difference and take the backup of Estressed SSO to you know right how to take the backup Just double click on that and go to the PSE and click on save as export to the your desktop Okay, no And SP ad so just to click on the display it will start all the Printers and you have to go to the edit and go to the selected transport It will lock into the one particular this we don't have any tables there printers. We don't have any tables Structured tables for that one what we will do will lock into the one particular Here that tip for that here again. I'll create the TLC why? This tear is creating in the quality system and quality system will be able to assign any target path for that part here Customizing and workbench now by it has a delivery route to the next system That's the reason we'll print the TLC tear for this one We'll include this tear changes into the TLC and we'll take release that TLC tear here like this And like this voice content repositories is there OS a zero So this is the one customer specific requirement everything they will give the evidence to you Okay, so we have to capture those things and then What you have to do DB refresh or DB restoration so source system to Source system means production target system means quality here what I done while preparation So while you have mentioned that quality so system and target system so that this year this document is for the Oracle guys this document for the Oracle so how to do so just go to the SAP backup and run the comment beer First you take the backup of the in the source system control file and edit that control file So Now log into the target system and run the beer restore ipandee This type in be backup name ipnm For I can see if I run this one it will start restoration and it will finish that Restoration Okay, so after that you have to delete the control file again you have to rerun the control file and you have to run the record database using backup control file until cancel and Then open reset logs. So your database will be started. These are not required ways nowadays Okay, you have to perform the post-repress tips first check the After restoration your database is connecting with the application application is connecting with the database or not by using r3 trans-ipadim if it is not connecting means what might be the reason your database might not be up and running or Stabilizer password might be different while production data it came right so that you have to Re-update so change reset the SAP sr3 password if it is above means Sorry if it is Anna means SAP above one reset that password and update into the Your r6 SFX files in Oracle in Anna HDB user store change the number of background work plus into zero And Then again test it and start the server first install the license and go to the SM 37 and remove the all the religious status jobs all the real status jobs select it here and permanently deleting them, okay, not all production jobs it should be deleted and then again re-import the profiles and Then make it make it change it to that Original value and then start your system start two changes is under your to date So Unconfigured that your STM is reconfigure the STM is and then the logical system name convention and Then from here until that different steps guys from here everything already you know Whatever we have taken back up those and all if any diversity has to be created those diversity as and are Again, we add it to queue and you are to import it. Those are master records also and Settings you are taking some screenshot reference right those and all again you have to We configure so delete the whatever it is come. So those and all you delete and We configure that's it Usually important certificates import And you have to run that SWA3 workflow definition workflow definition This is the overall system refresh will do it this okay, so this is one of the One more approaches This one first what they're given preparation steps of creation of system message is asking to post the message to every customer in the SM 0 2 when they're logging this has to be which means he is asking to notify the maintenance activity system Refresh active to the every user and then check space available in the Refresh on the target system target system is water Fighting so fighting if you have the very less data right will always will maintain that small sizes so productions DB sizes 4 TB here it is the 3.8 TB So space is not a rock so for that one you have to match the file system sizes file system sizes and then Decide which date backup need to be restored which means pittance as the customer to provide that till what date and time you need the restore and recovery is required and For that one you have to marry if you are using an online backup ensure that Archilox created during that time the backup was running and available in the for a arc location both the source and target stations are in the same Here this guy also talking about our accurate if it is an army same version this is nothing but Version okay, so both are in the same version target is in the air version though There is no issue, but sources in the air version target is in the version You can't restore it and the following steps can be done by Before the restores so and we have to wait until what are the time length they give in so tomorrow Restoration is doing miss today. You have to start the three replace steps so same but yet they give in the Equals size So what are it might be the customer what are it might be the Represented here. There is a small difference guys to our document and to this document Everything they steps they given how to take it But if you done one or two times practice of this one You can do anything so here they taken the all the tables data backup at voice level at voice level by using our three trans program What is that our three trans program? So by using our three trans program they take in the backup at the voice level but steps and the same but if you join in one customer they'll approach in that They'll give this kind of document if we some customers. They'll give the word document step by step. They'll maintain okay, so You have to do one or two times practice guys you do this practice Mostly okay, so After that you can do that what that word document by seeing you can easily understand after doing this one Okay, so we'll start it from here Here restoration process are positive fresh steps each and everything it will be here but these guys and all everything written in the Theoretical which one how to do They're asking to don't do that one, okay Ask they're asking to don't do that one, okay Now Okay, can I cook one hour But in the Urban the landscape Still estimates part bridges With estimates configuration any landscape is a guess Takes There will imagine okay, this is the production system, this is the quality system and we'll start it Who system is there I Share these three documents to this today review it Okay, each and everything you read how much knowledge you can gain in this guys. This is very very important That's a reason I'm taking very slow Okay, well you know, but it's the system that the magnetic index because clarity also, okay, so I take them I Take another race like any culture. We're gonna have one of our ability So they're pre-replaced of course. It's a problem. We really push up to restore is not a free system Okay, so guys Yeah, I'll share this three documents to you open three documents and analyze how it each and every step how it is done Imagine yourself, but keep maintain We will be the same So that may take you Yesterday I will show you the steps tomorrow So Everyone do you know systems really fresh steps and after that we take one back up and that will restore it and again post-it pre-stops will do it again, so But could I will share these three documents to you? So open each and every document as a preview pre-stops. What are the steps they are taken under? How to restore and how to do the post-it press? Everywhere it is common guys, okay, but the customer to customers some settings will be very some settings will be very okay So when they asked the entry question how to perform how you perform the system request, can you please explain that steps? Can you explain that steps you know need to tell why we need to perform the system? We push this and are just when you ask this kind of question Tell them yeah as part of system We wish I perform the first three three three steps that I have taken the some kind of screenshot I press like SAP license and the average more so than groups and 70 like this and up and HMS I see for people client settings is three shots and us and I go to the Take the user mastery context port and the log the Distribution model view partner profiles force those are not into the tables into that university are and release those DR And take the printers back up take the printer back up why is it you know back up and Estes test is going to back up RFC decision tables back up and If any like HTTP if you have the web this picture you have to consider that one also HTTP URL LOS table back up okay, so once we have finished all these three refreshes I have to restore the TV here If you are confident in explanation Explain them otherwise yeah, we have to drop the made to the backup team to restore the Production data in the party system by giving the feet point it and victory So they'll do that one once they're done and they go once we receive the mail so Restoration is finished. I will start performing the first refresh steps Okay, first of all, you are by after the concept ready whether application is connecting with database or not If not, I'll check the schema user or database owner user password. So it might be different So I'll reset that password and I can agree update it in that it should be just all if it is our honor if it is a miracle means ask the case effect and I Will make that number of background work positive zero and I'll start the application server and then I'll install the license and I'll clean up the all the background jobs which means delete the all the Production background jobs disable the spot completion and again You won't back the number of background work positive version and start take the restart and then Configure the HTML we configure that HTML and import the all the diversity as exports like visual master records and are and According to the screenshot reference each and every setting pivot back That's it Okay, so you I'm expecting from each and every one this kind of explanation Okay, so Today as a reference take it these documents and prepared landscape Sumit a client will be really new to your system log is one practice is it but while I'm showing I take the backup from Product and I'll restore into the quality system Okay, so that thing it will come straight instead of taking it between our system backup and within the system restoration So process to require it in a one more time. Okay, then so Need clear picture. If you understand this one, you can easily perform the migration Okay, everything right same real pre export ships, but additionally table splitting it will foundationally table splitting and data That's it System coffee data migration everything is safe I It's a nice start it involves are it was Corporate positive at least you can make it but quality system you have to make it like a development system Okay, the one controller you are changing but the quality system to consultation route to where you have to define 42 development it will define And a government from what? domain controller you can configure anybody can come to Okay, why this is to me the development gun we are changing audit policy we are going against to the audit policy So Every year every art nation they will do the art thing any security free features any Unauthorized logins or is there any data leakage? everything like a delight to PwC and the e way and Something KP 18 this kind of complex will be there every art nation. They will do the auditing data security art Okay, after that only they'll give the sick How strong this art nation is in the data security? There is a bit based on that only they will get the projects okay such kind of violation if anything is happened Fine we have to pay to that customers Okay, so that shouldn't be acceptable So as per policy only dash to be taken Okay Domain controller any very people popular but transport now see should be from the conservation or should be from development of party Okay Not party to any other system Everything they'll pack what did it change is happened from voice level database level application level everywhere they'll pack the data login history password change history parameter change history each and everything if they feel yes data leakage Happened immediately they lost explanation for example production client you open You should you should be in the closest status production plan should be enough first status due to some equity Reason you in emergency case you open the client customers will someone did the customization after that you closed Immediately will get the mail from audit team end of the year So why you open this one do you have any of the one we have any evidence? What changes they did we are the document? If you open by using ticket number, what is the ticket number if you have made? What is that made who given that for that approval each and everything there if you fail to submit that one? We Can't do anything that is customer regular so we lose the project here if I Connect you from the R if I release from the project or company so you only will be affected, but if I Continue one if I against to the customer if I went so if they told okay, we'll stop for project here me Close of rupees it will be lost to the company Even water that building pending also they will start later Okay, simply they'll be the reason you are the against the policy Have you been in county many were the best project? Okay, you know where's right so it's how big it is They did some mistake in the production system backup they aren't taken properly back up to you backup him they aren't taken the backup Perfectly even backup failing also they are noticed from past one week suddenly system is got crashed What I could do I can pick up the Last week only but what about my business data in this week what it is happened how I can bring it back All right, so they took various Customers told I lost almost 2 billion or some this much Urea dollars so you pay me the 1 billion Who needs to be paid somebody actually who get the last? But a backup team is touching me supporting me statue So how much big loss to that? Right so such kind of things instead of that so to you lost the demand what we will do We'll go with the bargain Okay, what do you want? So you will told I don't want to see this person's even in your company What I can do instead of paying 1 billion so I am saying Throw him outside and I like the one more person I'll show to the customer and again I'll bargain in the paying Amount okay. No, no again. We lost I Will pay 1 million. No, no you pay 50 million like this one What is the best amount to me and you it will come and that will pay as a pie to the customer? So in that situations what we can do anything every people think like a manager intentionally throw me outside Everyone who are come outside everyone the same story they return, but that's not reality They will do the lot of pressures from the customer side The ignition of the customer we can't do anything In company with HS we can fight for But as a it is the same company, but with the customer people we can't fight it Best example guys, I only finished In Mercedes Benz, okay, so I'm in the second shift I should so One of the first manager from the customer. I will sit in the customer second on second So you requested me to check one background job? He's going on top. So you told I can go on turn and I'll check it I'll take it mean when you are a question to martyr ask me whether that job is finished or not We put that history after that is that what it is after why he's asked me Montrose I don't know his senior his customer people. Okay, the question me to monitor. Okay, I'll take a room so you can go home So you asked me after going home whether the job is finished or not? So I told no, it's not finished He asked me and I take in this screenshot and send it to me Job log also send it to me and the teams shut down. So he is telling it's not visible to me It's not a visible to you means what I can do so slowly argument is started In being in between this might Almost is my leader in the customer side. Okay, customer people also is the leader service manager After half an hour argument so even I was if it's a top level management in the business So suddenly I raised my voice and I give him the credit Who taken you who gives the question as a service manager in this organization But why shouldn't they come from my mouth? Why I am the vendor to the message is I'm not customer right there. So You can't everyone is locking so you got angry and he cut the call and the next day He told to my entity data here management level and I'm he told I don't want to see him in the place So I went to the customer place and I'm doing my work. Everyone is laughing. He's sitting my beside He told like everyone knows Almost I given that is a almost big thing How would it be? But my wife in church that day, but I put my potential Which is he said that in episode higher level management and all came to data by afternoon So you went to the bathroom and everything they discussed and okay, so they come to me, okay tomorrow I'm not sick comment sit in the entity tremendous. I told you no no If you want to come there, it is me from the project. Otherwise, I don't want to work So if that situation is comes miss, I want to move it from here. It is from the product. I don't want this project so But other team members, they're not accepting in acetone fabricess\n\nStart the interview now."},{"role":"user","content":"Start the interview"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"type\": \"question\", \"content\": \"Okay, let's begin the interview.

After installation, configure system and memory parameters, create administrator users and roles, set up backups and high-availability/DR options, and apply any necessary patches.\nQuestion 4: Great. Now, could you tell me what are some common tasks involved in SAP HANA system administration?\nAnswer: Thought for a couple of seconds\n\n\nCommon SAP HANA administration tasks include:\n\n* **User & Security Management:** Create/maintain users, roles, privileges, and configure encryption/SSL.\n* **Monitoring & Performance Tuning:** Use HANA cockpit or SQL traces to monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and optimize workloads (e.g. workload classes, priority).\n* **Backup & Recovery:** Schedule full and incremental backups, configure log backups, and test restores.\n* **High Availability & System Replication:** Set up and monitor synchronous/asynchronous replication for failover and DR scenarios.\n* **Software Maintenance:** Apply Support Package Stacks (SPS), database revisions, and kernel updates via the Lifecycle Manager.\n* **Configuration Management:** Tune global/system parameters (e.g. memory allocation, persistence), manage alert configurations.\n* **Troubleshooting & Logging:** Analyze trace files, diagnostic alerts, SAP Notes for root-cause analysis and issue resolution.\nQuestion 5: Impressive overview. Can you explain what SAP HANA system replication is and why it is important in system administration?\nAnswer: Thought for a second\n\n\nSAP HANA system replication continuously copies data from a primary to one or more secondary HANA systems to enable near-zero downtime failover.\nIts critical for high availability and disaster recovery, ensuring business continuity by automatically switching to a synchronized standby in case of primary failure.\nQuestion 6: Well explained. Moving on, can you describe the basic steps involved in troubleshooting performance issues in an SAP HANA environment?\nAnswer: **Troubleshooting SAP HANA performance**\n\nTo troubleshoot performance issues in SAP HANA, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather system metrics, identify slow queries, and analyze expensive statements using HANA Studio or Cockpit.\n2. Check resource utilization, adjust indexes, optimize data models, and apply relevant patches.\n\n\nThought for 4 seconds\n\n\n1. Gather system and workload metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O) via SAP HANA Cockpit or Performance Trace and pinpoint slow SQL using PlanViz and SQL Monitor.\n2. Tune by optimizing data models (indexes, partitions), adjusting HANA parameters (memory allocation, thread pools), applying patches, and validating performance improvements.\nQuestion 7: Excellent. Can you tell me what security considerations are important when administering SAP HANA?\nAnswer: Thought for a couple of seconds\n\nKey security considerations when administering SAP HANA include:\n\n- **Authentication & Authorization:** Enforce strong password policies, integrate with corporate identity providers (e.g., SAML, LDAP), and follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and privileges.  \n- **Encryption:** Enable TLS for all client-server communication and activate data-at-rest encryption for persistence and backups to protect sensitive information.  \n- **Network Security:** Restrict HANA ports via firewalls, isolate the HANA network segment, and use secure tunnels or VPNs for remote access.  \n- **Patch & Change Management:** Regularly apply SAP Security Notes, Support Package Stacks, and kernel updates to remediate vulnerabilities.  \n- **Auditing & Monitoring:** Turn on audit logging for critical actions (schema changes, privilege assignments), centralize logs, and review security alerts in SAP HANA Cockpit or an SIEM.\nQuestion 8: Very comprehensive.
